# Requirement
## Description:
With the capability of AI, narrating a story from the given data becomes more feasible. For example, an AI system can describe a weather information and remind people to bring necessary items to deal with the weather. As another example, an AI system can interpret ECG data to support healthcare professionals in making decisions. In this challenge, our goal is to build a mobile application that meets the following requirements:

- The user shall upload data (e.g., a spreadsheet, a document, an image of the diagram, etc.).
- The system analyses the uploaded data and provides the corresponding story.
- The user shall be able to ask more questions about the story for clarification.
- For each user’s question, the system will respond the answer accordingly.
- The user shall revisit the story in the future.
- The user shall establish the connection between stories.
- The data is saved offline in the user machine.
- The data is also backed up online in the cloud provider.
## Technology stack:
We recommend some technology that you should use (but not limited):

- **Frontend:**
    - Web: React Typescript, Next Typescript, etc.
    - Mobile: React Native, Flutter, Kotlin, Swift, etc.
- **Backend:Python (FastAPI), Go, Rust, etc.
- **Database:** NoSQL or SQL
- **Operation:** Docker or Kubernetes
- **Cloud:** AWS, Azure or Google Cloud
## Notes:
- The developed application should follow the microservice design.
- We won’t have any specific restrictions or assumptions. This means you have full freedom in ideating your solution.
- You may not need to work on the machine learning components. However, you may need to think about the data schema of the output from the AI system that helps to address your tasks.
- You should be able to explain how the application's design can be scaled in future work.
